  title: GraphQL. Accelerated.
  extract: >
    GraphQL is a query language that combines type validation with a query and filtering syntax that makes it easy to
    get up-and-running with a powerful web API in almost no time. Add to that a vibrant community that keeps creating
    excellent tooling and documentation, it’s clear why GraphQL has become so popular with developers.
    Every abstraction has a cost, and GraphQL is no exception. The added complexity and a new schema format to parse
    and execute mean new performance bottlenecks. In addition to performance issues, the wrong use of GraphQL can lead
    to architectural bottlenecks.
    Instead of viewing this as a problem, we took this as a challenge, and in this talk, we will unveil how we made it
    run a lot faster on Node.js using different performance techniques that we have learned in the last few years.

  title: Build a Zero Knowledge backend with Node.js
  extract: >
    Zero Knowledge Architecture is a pattern that allow to build applications where all data is stored and exchanged in
    an encrypted way. It enforces end-to-end encryption and client-side operations only. Let's gonna see how to build a
    Zero Knowledge backend, involved in data transfer and keys-echange system, with a JS client-side lib. No more excuses
    not to secure your applications design.

  title: The Security Toolbox For Node
  extract: >
    Do you have a way to quickly check all of your repos for any vulnerabilities to various attacks? Do you know which
    attacks you should be preparing your applications for? In this talk, we will cover the top 10 attacks on Node
    applications and how to handle all of them. Multiple tools will be covered, all of which have been used in
    production across different back-end architectures.
    A few of the areas that will be covered include securing dependencies, securing data, and securing your server.
    By the end of this talk, attendees should have a full security toolbox and they will know how to implement it
    quickly. This will help with production applications because you will still get through your sprints on time and you
    will be able to rest knowing you have security measures in place.

  title: Rapid and type-safe Node.js development with Prisma
  extract: >
    For developers that embrace rapid development, working with relational databases comes with a lot of challenges.
    But it’s possible to optimize for developer experience without compromising on reliability with Prisma – an
    open-source end-to-end type-safe database toolkit for TypeScript and Node.js. In this workshop, we’ll introduce
    Prisma and learn how it enables rapid and type-safe development while addressing common problems in data-centric
    applications.

  title: Examining Observability in Node.js
  extract: >
    Imagine your productivity and confidence developing web apps without chrome dev tools. Many do exactly that with
    Node.js. It is important to observe and learn what's happening in your app to stay competitive and create the most
    performant and efficient Node.js applications, following the best practices.
    In this talk, we will explore useful tools to examine your Node.js applications and how observability will speed up
    development, produce better code while improving reliability and uptime. Don't miss it!

  title: The gentle touch of APM - how code tracing works in Node.js
  extract: >
    It has been a busy several years in monitoring and observability. As we’ve hit limits on the visibility and detail
    that logging and metrics provide, we’ve turned to tracing and APM (App Performance Monitoring) systems. We can now
    understand performance bottlenecks and see errors in our apps down to the line of code. But how do they really work
    under the hood? Come and find out! We'll walk through how a free APM system works - Elastic APM.
    - Elastic APM's tech architecture
    - how its Node.js agent hooks deep into web apps
    - how web frameworks allow us to perform tracing more easily than you might think
    This talk is friendly to a variety of backgrounds and levels of experience. It would help a lot if you have worked
    on a production web app, but the focus is on giving an introduction.
